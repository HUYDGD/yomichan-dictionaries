<!-- - [x] if simp/trad form exist, check for presence in list and add if not
- [x] if find "used in vocab" with new kanji, add that kanji to list
  - nvm
- [x] add composed of/included in kanji (check for existence of included in kanji, fetch bigger page if necessary?)
  - nvm to included in
- [ ] check jpdb freq list for all kanji used, if not insane number just use that as base
  - nvm dont feel like it
- [ ] use thekanjimap data for thekanjimap kanji dict
- [ ] dict converter
  - [ ] limit to 10 vocab, show more link to jpdb -->

  - [x] https://web.archive.org/web/20190309073023/https://forum.koohii.com/thread-9459.html#pid168613
    - [x] 6430 kanji used, so more expansive than jpdb?
- [ ] get kanken https://github.com/bhffmnn/kanken-json
- [ ] get shinjitai/kyuujitai/itaiji https://github.com/epistularum/jitai
  - [ ] also use jpdb data, some stuff not in jitai but keiyoujitai not in jpdb
- [ ] get components/used in thekanjimap https://github.com/gabor-kovacs/the-kanji-map/tree/main/data
  - [ ] also add radicals' entries from it hopefully, maybe separate dic for meaning/etc info


- [ ] convert the kanji dicts to proper kanji dicts

- [ ] kotoba memes: use innocent list, aggregate every single mono dict, get terms with a kanji with certain freq (>3000?), under 4 chars.
